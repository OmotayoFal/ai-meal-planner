# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `node.js`
runs the backend as well

As a uni student who’s often indecisive about what to cook (and occasionally tempted by takeout 🙃), I wanted something quick, private, and budget-friendly — no sign-ups, no emails, no friction.

Just enter your weekly budget, preferences, and cooking level, and it generates 5 meals under your budget with a reusable shopping checklist you can actually tick off 

This project pushed me to combine multiple skills:
⚙️ React + Tailwind for a clean, responsive UI
⚡ Express.js for the backend
🧠 Groq API (LLMs) for natural-language meal generation
💾 LocalStorage for simple, privacy-first data persistence

It’s simple by design — but it taught me a lot about API integration, JSON handling, UX flow, and keeping AI outputs structured and reliable.

Not every project has to be huge — sometimes the best learning comes from solving your own small daily problems.
